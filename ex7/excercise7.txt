NG|THE|TIRED|AND|STICKY|FACES|

To solve this general substitution I first did a frequency analysis of the
cyphertext to find the first and second most common characters in tess27, | and
E respectively. Using this knowledge I then did the following, substituting as
I went:

Counter({'G': 156, 'M': 90, 'B': 59, 'U': 56, 'K': 54, 'Z': 53, 'L': 47,
'P': 45, '|': 42, 'I': 36, 'S': 35, 'A': 24, 'H': 21, 'F': 18, 'R': 16,
'O': 16, 'J': 13, 'Q': 13, 'X': 13, 'W': 11, 'T': 8, 'D': 7, 'C': 4, 'V': 2,
 'E': 1})

'G' is clearly '|' and 'M' is likely to be 'E'

Step 1: replace G with ' '
Step 2: Look for THE (M is probaly E)
    UBM repeats a lot, probably THE.
Step 3: look for Repeating Letter
    2x FF
    1x II
    2x KK
    3x LL : most common, possibly ll... inconclusive
    1x MM
    2x OO
    1x VV
Step 4: replace and look for words, start with U, B & M for 'the'
    Commonly found:
    he|: her or hes?
    Lhe: must be she assuming 'the' was correct; L = s
        therefore | is probably r
            found 'threshers', sounds good so far!
    sI Zs tI De: 4 2 letter words together... weird.
    theJ: they, them, thee, then...
    arJs: J probably m
    several Zt and Zs: Z probably i
        nope found a 'thit': Z = a
    Rrame: R probably f
    faAts: A probably c
    PKcessaKt: most likely incessant: P = i, K = n,
    anS : S = d
    seFarated: F = p
    preCented: C = v
    chanQinQ: Q = g
    fOapping: O = l
    tI, If: I = o
    Homen, Hhich: H = w
    conscioXsness: X = u
    clung to them liTe dull flames: T = k
    independentlW: W = y
    Donnet, emDrowned, Dy: D = B
    Euivering: E = q
    iVV: V = z

Done!
