I conducted frequency analysis of the letters for all the possible key lengths.
These results are in the comments of my python program. Sadly, this didn't
reveal which was the most likely key length to me I then looked at the
coincidences in the cyphertext (how many times the character is the same as
the one several spaces back). It appeared that there were more coincidences
every time I looked at a character a multiple of 8 behind. This led me to
believe the key length was 8. Thankfully I that was correct.

Using the frequency analysis I put in my most likely shift values:
shift = {
    0: 7,
    1: 9,
    2: 19,
    3: 13,
    4: 23,
    5: 11,
    6: 10,
    7: 4
}

Not there, so I changed the 0 shift value to something equally likely:
shift = {
    0: 8,
    1: 9,
    2: 19,
    3: 13,
    4: 23,
    5: 11,
    6: 10,
    7: 4
}

FIELD! I see field, very promising. I now change the 6 shift to it's next most
likely candidate:
shift = {
    0: 8,
    1: 9,
    2: 19,
    3: 13,
    4: 23,
    5: 11,
    6: 20,
    7: 4
}

Still not right, change the 6 shift again:
shift = {
    0: 8,
    1: 9,
    2: 19,
    3: 13,
    4: 23,
    5: 11,
    6: 2,
    7: 4
}

Something else must need changed. However, field Rose might make sense. THR
would become THE as well so this seems like a good bet. Even though I thought
the shift at position 5 was very likely, I change it to the next most likely
candidate:
shift = {
    0: 8,
    1: 9,
    2: 19,
    3: 13,
    4: 23,
    5: 24,
    6: 6,
    7: 4
}
