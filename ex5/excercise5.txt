I created a program that would read the cyphertext and put it into columns.
I then read the columns row-wise to find the plain text. I didn't know the
number of columns, so I simply repeated the process 4 times to find all the
possibilities, only one was recognisably English and so I checked that the
resulting extract occurred in tess26.txt.
