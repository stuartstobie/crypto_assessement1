I conducted frequency analysis of the cyphertext, to find the most frequently
occuring characters in the positions which would be affected by the same letter
of the unknown key, i.e. frequencies of characters at position n(m%6). This
yielded a most likely key, which thankfully turned out to be correct. I then
used the key to convert to plaintext as I did in exercise 2. I checked that the
resulting extract occurred in tess26.txt.
