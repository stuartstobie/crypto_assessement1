Firstly I created a program to read the cyphertext columwise, simlar to
excercise 5. I then generated all the possible permutations of 0-6 using this
site: http://textmechanic.com/Permutation-Generator.html
I used these permutations to read the columns row-wise in all (720)possible
orders. I searched the output for common English words and found a result which
was recognisably english when colums were read in [1, 0, 4, 3, 2, 5] order. I
checked that the resulting extract occurred in tess26.txt.
